<h1>About me</h1>
<img src="images/me.jpg" width="500" height="1000">	

My name is Leonard. I'm a 26 year old male of Vietnamese descent. 
I am a <strong>casual hobbyist weightlifter</strong>, I used to be a provincial level olympic weightlifter; however, I decided to be a <em>lazy casual</em> instead.
Mainly because the work volume per week of weightlifting is tiring and draining on the joints, ligaments, muscles, nervous system, etc.

<h2>Why am I in CIT?</h2>
I chose to pursue CIT because I thought I'd be okay, or good enough at it as I've grown up with hardware/software, like many others in the program.
Three courses I'm taking are:
<li>ACIT 1620; Please see the outline <a href="here">https://www.notion.so/Week-1-49432f4df382495f92a5c80d872043c8</a></li>
<li>ACIT 1515</li>
<li>ACIT 1420</li>
